Here is the full documentation of Freezer Agent installation and how to use it to download and upload files. We will go through every option that I have made
available.


NOTE!!!!!
  If you must need to authenticate I need to give the advice to contanct your system administrator to give you the authenticcation files neede for continuing the
  operation if you must. and if you don't need to authenticate you can just jump into it.
  
Note: If you neede to authenticate use the freezer-agent authentication method.

Option NO.1
  Dwonloads and installs the freezer agent that make connection to the freezer-api installed in the server.

Option NO.2
  If you have Openstack object sotre (Swift) installed in your server you can make some of your backups into that Container that you can access.
